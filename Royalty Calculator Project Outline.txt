ROYALTY CALCULATOR TODO:

- Modify Licenses File:
    - Add UPCs
    - Update product-type fields, so they are only CD, LP, or All Digital

- Modify Physical Sales File:
    - Make sure catalog numbers exactly match catalog numbers in licenses file


PHYSICAL SALES FILE PROCESSING WORKFLOW:
- For each line of the physical sales file remember the: product-type (which will be either LP or CD), UPC, and net-units
- For each line in the Licenses file that matches both UPC AND product-type add the following in columns to a new spreadsheet called royalty-run: publisher, album-title, catalog-no, upc, track-title, ISRC, product-type, share, net-rate (a separate calculation derived from rate-type x rate-percent x song-length (a separate calculation derived from track-minutes x 60 + track-seconds) OR penny rate), net-units (from the sales file sheet), balance (a calculation of share x net-rate x net units)
- Do not include negative net units on physical sales sheet (enter as 0)

DIGITAL ALBUM SALES FILE PROCESSING WORKFLOW:
- Combine the digital album sales from The Orchard and the BSR website into one file
- The product type for every line in this file will be DA (Download Album)
- For each line in the digital album sales file, remember the product-type (DA), UPC, and net-units
- For each line in the Licenses file that matches the UPC AND has the product-type "All Digital" add the following in columns to the spreadsheet called royalty-run: publisher, album-title, catalog-no, upc, track-title, ISRC, product-type, share, net-rate (a separate calculation derived from rate-type x rate-percent x song-length (a separate calculation derived from track-minutes x 60 + track-seconds) OR penny rate), net-units (from the sales file sheet), balance (a calculation of share x net-rate x net units)

DIGITAL TRACK SALES FILE PROCESSING WORKFLOW:
- for each line of the digital sales file with DT (Download Track) as the Trans Type:
    - for each Orchard UPC
        - for each ISRC
        - count the total number of that ISRC
- with the count of each ISRC per UPC:
    - For each line in the Licenses file that matches both ISRC AND UPC add the following in columns to the royalty-run spreadsheet: publisher, album-title, catalog-no, upc, track-title, ISRC, product-type, share, net-rate (a separate calculation derived from rate-type x rate-percent x song-length (a separate calculation derived from track-minutes x 60 + track-seconds) OR penny rate), net-units (from the sales file sheet), balance (a calculation of share x net-rate x net units)

ROYALTY-RUN SPREADSHEET PROCESSING WORKFLOW:
- sort by publisher, then catalog-no, then ISRC, then product-type
- Add the individual license balances of each product type together: for each ISRC, add the sum of the balance of each product-type, and insert this on a new row with the same publisher, album-title, catalog-no, track-title, ISRC, and a new column to hold the sum called license-balance
- While retaining the original copy of the royalty-run spreadsheet, create a new individual spreadsheet for each publisher that is an exact copy of the data in the royalty-run spreadsheet
- Create PDF statements from the individual publisher electronic statements
